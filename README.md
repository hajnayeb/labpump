# Desinging a Laboratory Pump
**- At the University of Calgary, I designed and manufactured a test rig for evaluating a centrifugal pump in cavitation condition.**

**- It has a transparent covering in order to make it possible to see the flow around the impeller.**

**- The final system components are shown in the following picture. A mechanical seal is used on the shaft to avoid leakage. I manufactured the parts using a lathe (for machining the shaft), milling machine (for creating the keyway), waterjet (for cutting the trasparent covering), and 3Dprinters (for manufacturing the casing and supports), and then, assembled them as shown below:**
