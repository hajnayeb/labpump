# Desinging a Laboratory Pump
**- At the University of Calgary, I designed and manufactured a test rig for evaluating a centrifugal pump in cavitation condition.**

**- It has a transparent covering in order ot make it possible to see the flow around the impeller.**

**- The final system components are shown in the following picture. I manufactured the parts using lathe, milling machine, and 3Dprinters, and then, assembled them as shown below:**
